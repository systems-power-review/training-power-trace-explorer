# Google Drive data setup

The review site loads intentionally public JSON and CSV trace records at run
time from Google Drive; no trace data is deployed with the site.

## One-time Google setup

1. Create a Google Cloud project and enable **Google Drive API**.
2. Create a browser API key restricted to:
   - API restriction: Google Drive API
   - Website restriction: the exact anonymous review origin, for example
     `https://systems-power-review.github.io/*`
3. Create an empty Google Drive folder for the public dataset. The migration
   script will add `runs`, `metadata`, and `raw` subfolders.
4. Obtain a short-lived OAuth access token with Google Drive write permission.
   Keep it only in your terminal environment; do not commit or paste it into
   source control.

## Migrate the current public traces

Run the following from the repository while the original `github-pages/public-data`
folder is still present locally:

```bash
node scripts/migrate_public_data_to_drive.mjs --dry-run

GOOGLE_DRIVE_ACCESS_TOKEN="..." \
GOOGLE_DRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID="..." \
node scripts/migrate_public_data_to_drive.mjs
```

The script uploads every catalog record, detail JSON, metadata JSON, and raw
CSV. It makes every uploaded file public read-only and prints the catalog file
ID when complete.

## Configure the anonymous review site

In **GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**,
add these repository variables:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY` | Browser-restricted API key from Google Cloud |
| `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CATALOG_FILE_ID` | Value printed by the migration script |

The API key is intentionally included in the browser bundle because visitors
need it to read the public Drive files. It must have no write privileges and be
restricted to the anonymous review Pages origin above. OAuth credentials and
migration access tokens are never included in the website.

Deploy the static site after marking the catalog and all referenced artifacts
public read-only. The existing visual interface, charts, filtering, raw-data
table, and downloads then read from Google Drive.

## Ongoing updates

When adding a new trace, run the same migration with the updated local dataset,
then replace the two repository variables with the catalog file ID printed by
the new migration. A later upload-and-review workflow can automate this process
without changing the public viewer.
